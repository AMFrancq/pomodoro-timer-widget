# Pomodoro Timer Widget

This is a small widget that runs on a Linux system. It's built using Python, Tkinter for the GUI, and SQLite for data storage. The widget functions as a timer, helping users implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.

## Tech Stack

- Python: This versatile language is perfect for creating small applications and is widely supported on almost all platforms, including Linux.
- Tkinter: This is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit. It's the most commonly used method for creating graphic user interfaces with Python.
- SQLite: This is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database. It doesnâ€™t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language.

## Application Structure

1. The application imports the necessary modules (Tkinter, SQLite3).
2. It creates a main window for the application.
3. It adds widgets (buttons, labels, text boxes, etc.) to the main window.
4. It defines the functionality for each widget, including starting, pausing, and resetting the Pomodoro timer.
5. It creates a database connection and tables if necessary, to store the user's Pomodoro sessions.
6. It implements the logic for storing and retrieving data from the database.
7. It runs the main loop for the application.

## Installation

TODO: Develop an `apt-get` installation process for the application.

## Usage

The Pomodoro Timer Widget helps you implement the Pomodoro Technique. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.
